# Simple Addon Manager
This addon was created because I always missed some features with the existing alternatives.

Some of its features:
* Profile
* Search (by Name, Title, Author...)
* Custom and autogenerated Categories. The autogenerated is done reading 'X-Category' variable in the .toc file of the addon, this requires the author of that addons to declare it.
* Sorting (by Name, Title, and an "Improved" mode that ignores some characters to make it more natural)
* Tooltip for the addons list with some extra info
* Resizable window
